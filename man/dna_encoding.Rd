\title{DNA 5-mer one-hot encoding}
\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_strings)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_strings}{A character vector of DNA sequences. All sequences must
have the same length (e.g. \code{"ATCGA"} or \code{c("ATCGA", "TTGCA")}).}
}
\value{
A data frame where:
\itemize{
\item Each row corresponds to one DNA sequence
\item Each column corresponds to a nucleotide position
\item Column names follow the format \code{"nt_pos1"}, \code{"nt_pos2"}, etc.
\item Values are factors with levels \code{"A"}, \code{"T"}, \code{"C"}, \code{"G"}
}
}
\description{
This function converts DNA sequences into a matrix-like data frame in which
each nucleotide position becomes a separate column. Each entry is stored as
a factor with four possible levels: \code{"A"}, \code{"T"}, \code{"C"}, \code{"G"}.

This encoding format is often used in machine learning models, where
sequence characters must be transformed into numeric or categorical values
before prediction.

\examples{
# Example with one sequence
dna_encoding("ATCGA")

# Example with multiple sequences
dna_encoding(c("ATCGA", "TTGCA"))
